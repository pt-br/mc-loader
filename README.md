MoovCheckout Script Loader v3
---

Original idea and v1.0 creator: [Douglas Hipolito](https://github.com/douglashipolito).

Thanks to [William Lima](https://github.com/williammustaffa) for the support.

What does this extension do?
---
It injects the _experience.js_ script from [MoovCheckout](http://www.moovweb.com/moovcheckout/) to a determined site, this way, you don't have to run a _moov server_ instance, only the optimize server.

It also injects [MoovCheckout Workbench](https://github.com/pt-br/mc-workbench) if you want to use it.

How can I install it?
---
It's simple. Just clone this repository, go to your extensions on Chrome(be sure to check the developer mode checkbox) and load this folder to your browser as a extension.

How can I use it?
---
Everything you need to do is provide part of the URL(or the entire URL, if you prefer). It works as a regex, so it's pretty cool :)
